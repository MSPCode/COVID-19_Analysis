<h4> Business Problem Introduction:</h4>
In the context of the recent global COVID-19 pandemic, this project will review and analyze the disease progression in the United States. 
The goal of this project is to provide visualization maps that help understand future disease progression. 
It also provides a visual representation of confirmed, active, and death cases to predict the mortality rates for each region (county).

<h4> Data Sources: </h4>

The John Hopkins University and New York Times provide daily coronavirus case reports in CSV format, which includes detail about confirmed, active, and death cases pre county and per state. The data provide by both sources are intended for global prediction; this project will use only a subset to identify the trends within the United States.
